PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other n − h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Example 1:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Example 2:
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int len = citations.length;
        int[] count = new int[len + 1];

        for (int c: citations)
            if (c > len) 
                count[len]++;
            else 
                count[c]++;


        int total = 0;
        for (int i = len; i >= 0; i--) {
            total += count[i];
            if (total >= i)
                return i;
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
