/*
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.
You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the ' ' character.

Example:
If file.txt has the following content:

name age
alice 21
ryan 30
Output the following:

name alice ryan
age 21 30
*/

# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
head -1 file.txt | wc -w | xargs seq 1 | xargs -I{} -n 1 sh -c "cut -d ' ' -f{} file.txt | paste -sd ' ' -"
